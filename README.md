## **Using Image Recognition for Hand Tracking in Mobile VR**
A basic problem in Mobile VR(Google Cardboard like platforms) is the loss of interface(interaction between the user and the device) since mobiles mostly use their screens for interaction with the user which gets lost in Google Cardboard like systems because the screen sits in the VR headset(like Google Cardoard).
This severely restricts the possibilities of creation for the developer as there is virtually no interaction with the user.

**Using Image Recognition**
One possible solution is to use the back camera of the device to track an image target.
Moving the target can be used as a virtual cursor in the Virtual environment.
I created an example level where the virtual cursor aims a gun.

**Built with**

 1. Unity3D 5.6.0f3 64bit
 2. Vuforia SDK 6.0.0
 
**Contributing**
I see this project as just one of the solutions to make the Google Cardboard experience better.You can contribute by reporting about the experience (eg. how the accuracy of the image recognition technique being used plays a role in the experience)
